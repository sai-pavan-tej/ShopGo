# Shop GO

## Overview
Shop GO is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to revolutionize the shopping experience through the power of Internet of Things (IoT). 

## Features
The application introduces speed and efficiency to the shopping process with a suite of powerful tools and capabilities:

1. **RFID Technology:** Each shopping cart is equipped with an RFID scanner, and every product carries an RFID tag. This setup ensures a seamless shopping experience, allowing instant item recognition and tallying.

2. **Particle Photon Microcontroller:** We leverage Particle Photon as a microcontroller, offering robust and reliable operations.

3. **Razor Pay Integration:** Shoppers can view their purchased items and make payments directly through the app using Razor Pay. This digital transaction method reduces waiting time at checkout points and enhances the overall shopping experience.

4. **Firebase-powered:** The application is powered by Firebase, ensuring secure and efficient data handling for a smooth and reliable user experience.

5. **DialogFlow Chatbot:** Our integrated DialogFlow chatbot is always ready to assist customers. From locating items and providing in-store discounts to answering queries, our AI-powered assistant makes shopping easier than ever.

## Objective
